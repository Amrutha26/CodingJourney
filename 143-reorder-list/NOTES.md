#### Three small subproblems here:
- Find the middle of the linkedlist and have reference to the head and tail of the two separated lists
- Reverse the second half of the list
- Merge two lists
â€‹
Note: Always have reference to some particular node so that it becomes easier: For eg, we use l1_next and l2_next for merging two lists
