DP: No. of unique ways, can also be broken down into simpler sub problems
â€‹
- Initially write the recursive code though DP is the best approach
- We use 2D DP matrix because the q mentions a grid
- Think how we can fill the DP matrix (answers to sub problems)
- When to add or multiply: compare this q and unique binary search trees
