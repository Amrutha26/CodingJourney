- To find the pivot : Binary Search : O(Logn)
- After finding the pivot, it's easier to see the boundaries and search using normal BS
- To find the target : Binary Search : O(logn)
- Time complexity : O(2logn) -> O(logn) (Constants are ignored)
​
In another approach :
- We don't need to traverse to find the pivot element
- In a single pass, we can find the target element
