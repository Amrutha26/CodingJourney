After finding the solution for the 0th subproblem, for example here,
for n = 1 -> there's only one way to climb up the stairs
- Once we have a basis, we can build and solve something like dp[2]
- We need to create an array to store the subproblems
- Solve the sub problems first. Use them as base cases to solve the unknowns.
​
Approaches:
- Brute Force (All possible combinations)
- Recursion with Memoization (Memo array)
- DP (Bottom up) - efficient
