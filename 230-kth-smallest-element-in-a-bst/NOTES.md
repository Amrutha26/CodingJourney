Inorder Traversal: An inorder traversal technique follows the Left Root Right policy. Here, Left Root Right means that the left subtree of the root node is traversed first, then the root node, and then the right subtree of the root node is traversed.

Inorder traversal: Kth element in that is the answer

**Inorder traversal of a binary search tree will give an ascending order**

Use normal recursion or Iterative stack

Know how the recursive calls work
